"""Graph-scoped context builder — a Graphify-style proxy in front of the LLM.

Instead of reading every file in a project, this module builds (or loads
from cache) a directed import graph over the project's source files — nodes
are files, edges are internal (project-local) imports/includes. From a
user-supplied entrypoint, it walks the graph with a depth-bounded BFS and
concatenates the full contents of every file reached into one context
string, ready to be injected into an LLM prompt alongside the user's query.

Python gets full AST-based import resolution (handles relative imports,
``from X import Y`` submodule-vs-attribute ambiguity, etc.). Every other
supported language (JS/TS, Rust, C/C++) gets a deliberately simple regex
scan for its own import/include syntax — good enough to catch the common,
literal cases (``import x from './y'``, ``mod foo;``, ``#include "foo.h"``)
but not a real parser. Known unresolved cases, all of which just yield
*fewer* edges (never wrong ones): JS/TS dynamic ``import('./x')`` and
bundler path aliases (``@/x``), Rust ``use crate::`` paths (only ``mod``
declarations are file-graph edges and those are caught), and macro- or
``<system>``-style C includes. A miss here just means that file's edges
are incomplete, not wrong — same fail-open philosophy as the Python path's
entrypoint detection. Note the regex scanners are not comment-aware, so an
import mentioned inside a comment or a disabled ``#if 0`` block can add a
spurious edge; that only ever *widens* the neighborhood (keeps an extra
file), never drops a real one.

External/third-party imports are not resolvable to a project file and are
simply not added as edges — the graph only ever contains project-internal
files.

No token-limiting, truncation, or summarization happens here by design: the
full content of every reachable file is returned verbatim. Bounding total
size is the caller's (or the LLM API's) responsibility.

The graph is cached under ``headroom.paths.graph_context_cache_dir()``,
keyed by content hashes of every supported source file under the project
root. Any file addition, removal, or edit invalidates the cache and
triggers a rebuild; an unchanged tree is loaded straight from cache. Writes
to that cache file are atomic (temp file + rename) so a reader never
observes a half-written file, even with multiple Headroom processes
sharing the same cache path.

      the build. ``os.walk`` sidesteps that entirely.
    * **Pruning.** Ignored/vendor dirs (``node_modules``, ``.git``,
      ``target``, …) are pruned from ``dirnames`` in place, so the walk
      never descends into them at all — instead of walking the whole tree
