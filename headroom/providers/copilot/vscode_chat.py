"""Route VS Code Copilot **Chat** through Headroom via the Custom Endpoint provider.

Why this exists alongside ``vscode.py``
---------------------------------------
``vscode.py`` writes ``github.copilot.advanced.debug.overrideProxyUrl``. That knob
targets Copilot's **completions** endpoint; chat talks to the CAPI endpoint, whose
knob is ``overrideCapiUrl`` -- so the existing wrapper never actually redirected
chat traffic. Both are undocumented debug settings, and the Chat extension has
been observed ignoring them outright
(microsoft/vscode-copilot-release#7802, closed unfixed, repo archived).

VS Code ships a supported alternative: the **Custom Endpoint** BYOK provider
(``vendor: "customendpoint"``), configured through ``chatLanguageModels.json``.
It speaks ``chat-completions``, ``responses`` and ``messages`` -- all three of
which the Headroom proxy already serves -- so the proxy can simply *be* the
endpoint, with no protocol work.

What this buys, and what it does not
------------------------------------
Chat and agent traffic flows through Headroom and is compressed, and **every**
model the account is entitled to appears in the picker, so a user can switch
models mid-session exactly as they do natively.

It does **not** cover inline (ghost-text) completions, semantic search, or
embeddings: VS Code routes those through GitHub regardless of BYOK. Callers must
say so rather than implying full coverage.
