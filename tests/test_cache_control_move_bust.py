"""Reproduce the residual cache-bust: client MOVING cache_control defeats the
prefix overlay.

Real clients (Claude Code, litellm) move the cache_control breakpoint to the
newest message every turn — so a message that was marked last turn is unmarked
this turn (its dict bytes change). The first overlay fix compared *raw* message
dicts for its append-only guard, so a moved marker in the frozen prefix made the
guard fail → the overlay skipped the replay → the raw freeze forwarded ORIGINAL
bytes over the cached COMPRESSED prefix → partial bust (the ~42% residual seen
on the a10 run, with prefix_change=0).

These tests pin the exact scenario, prove the content-only guard fixes it, and
document the remaining piece (marker accumulation > 4 → needs stable placement).
